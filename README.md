# Structured Sparsification of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks

This repo contains the paper, poster and slides for our AAAI-2020 paper Structured Sparsification of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks.

The code for experiments with Bayesian sparsification is availible [here](https://github.com/tipt0p/SparseBayesianRNN).
The code for experiments with magnitude pruning will be uploaded soon.
